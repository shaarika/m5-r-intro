# Exercise-1: practice with basic syntax

# Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born
hometown <- "London"

# Assign your name to the variable `my.name`
my.name <- "Shaarika Kaul"

# Assign your height to a variable `my.height`
my.height <- "5'4"

# Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have
puppies <- 1

# Create a variable `puppy.price`, which is how expensive you think a puppy is
puppy.price <- 900

# Create a variable `total.cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies
total.cost <- 900

# Create a boolean variable `too.expensive`, set to true if the cost is greater than $1,000
if (total.cost > 1000) {
  too.expensive <- TRUE
}

# Create a variable `max.puppies`, which is the nuber of puppies you can afford for $1K.
max.puppies <- 1
